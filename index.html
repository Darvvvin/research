		<p> <h1>The Implications of Extracurricular Activities on the Study Habits of High School Students of De La Salle Santiago Zobel School </h1>
<h2> Abstract </h2>
<font face="arial">
			Recently issues regarding overstressing and multitasking different extracurricular activities can greatly impact a student’s academic performance. Some related studies states that  students who involve themselves in extracurricular activities generally benefit in ways such as learning and applying different skills and values such as teamwork, leadership and good moral behavior. This research study is a brief and concise study on the implications of a student’s participation in extracurricular activities on the study habits of De La Salle Zobel High School Students. The purpose of this research is to identify the different effects of managing various extra-curricular activities while simultaneously coping with academic work on a person, specifically a student’s overall performance. Also to determine whether or not the activities in which high school students choose to get involved in have an effect on their academic performance. The study’s data gathering instrument mainly consists of information gathered through conducting interviews and surveys that was distributed to different students of the high school level of De La Salle Santiago Zobel School.  Data gathered from the research conducted can be beneficial in terms of  informing audiences such as psychologists and school administrators on the different implications of extracurricular activities that can bring onto a person specifically students and how it impacts their academic performance which could be used for future references.

		<p> <h1>Factors that influenced the effectiveness of DLSZ-V Grade 11 STEM student’s time management skills in relation to academic performance 2016-2017</h1>
<h2> Abstract </h2>
<font face="arial">
			Time management is the process and practice of proper planning and organizing of time for activities to be done day to day. Time management is a key component for a proper balance of responsibilities especially to students with extracurricular activities. These factors are distinct and plays a unique role in time management. Responsibilities is a huge factor that affects time management, mainly because of an individual’s priorities and what they value to be done the most. As for social environment, this refers to an influential aspect within the individual’s peers. Lastly, the Academic Standing focusing on the student’s quantifiable academic achievements and failures.

		<p> <h1>The Effect of Complete Fertilizer towards the Chemical Composition of Different Types of Soil</h1>
<h2> Abstract </h2>
<font face="arial">
			Soil is made up of primary micronutrients and secondary micronutrients. Primarily, it is composed of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, with additional components being calcium, magnesium and sulfur, all of which are necessary nutrients for both plants and soil microorganisms. The soil may also contain boron, copper, iron, chlorine, molybdenum, manganese, and zinc, which act as sources of additional sustenance.
<br><br>
In this study, the researchers will explore the chemical components of synthetic fertilizer, and observe how these components affect the composition, quality, and fertility of soil. Additionally, it will differentiate the aforementioned effects of synthetic fertilizer on the three different types of soil, namely clay, loam, and sand.

		<p> <h1>A Physical Guide to Better Soil and Crop Management based on their Profiled Levels of N, P, K and pH</h1>
<h2> Abstract </h2> 
<font face="arial">
			Given the results of the previous research entitled “The Effects of Ramgo Complete Fertilizer Towards the Chemical Composition of Different Types of Soil”, the researchers plan to utilize these findings as a basis on ensuring proper soil quality for the specific plants being used in the communities of Calatagan, Batangas. As a summary, the results from this research mainly indicated that there were generally significant differences in terms of how sand, loam and clay soil reacts chemically to the fertilizer, as each had varying cation exchange capacities. With this, it was concluded that despite their differences, the most ideal soil may not be determined, as the soil efficiency is dependent as well on the type of plant being used. Knowing this, the researchers were able to propose a simple project targeting soil and crop management on the community.
<br><br>
			This community is known to have 3 types of soil, namely, Calumpang Clay Loam, Taal Sandy Loam and Sibul Clay Loam. Each currently being used to grow certain types of plants such as sugarcane, rice, sorghum, coconut, fruit trees and vegetables. However, certain circumstances such as the infertility of the soil and the insufficiency of certain nutrients the soil must provide as preconditions to accommodate with a specific type of crop may have substantially significant negative effects to the yield of such crops. Thus, it is vital to understand and study the conditions within the community to propose a solution aimed to optimize such complications.

<h2> Hi! I'm Jacob Darvin </h2><h3>(AKA Darvin)</h3> <font face="arial">
			I study in De La Salle Santiago Zobel under the STEM strand. I am a researcher and research conductor who has so far helped developed 4 research papers over the past 2 years of Senior Highschool. I am involved and one of the founding members of Developer's Society, a Zobel based tech org that promotes STEM and the development of computer science related skills such as media and code. Being a part of that org helped me learn a lot of skills that chanelled onto the development of my research papers. Such skills include<b> Video Editing, Photoshop, Graphic Design</i> and many more that I use to develop most of my group's media related outputs such as powerpoints, posters and videos.
			<br><br></font>
			Every so often I enjoy taking time off of school work and fancy a life apart from academics. I enjoy challenges and learning new things.<i> Life is short, always aim for something better. Hardship often prepares an ordinary person for an extraordinary destiny. </i>
<h3>Learning Objectives </h3> <font face="arial">
			The objective of this research was to help me improve my research and writing skills. This helps me prepare and perform better in college and become competitive in a professional world. My previous researches were aimed to help me and my groupmates understand the basics of writing a thesis and the principles, disciplines and etiquette of performing a formal study. 
<br><br></font>
			In general, this research course significantly helped me get a better understanding of what its like to perform a research study and how I can develop and improve my writing, surveying and research related skills.
