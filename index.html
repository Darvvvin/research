		<p> <h1>The Implications of Extracurricular Activities on the Study Habits of High School Students of De La Salle Santiago Zobel School </h1>
<h2> Abstract </h2>
<font face="arial">
			Recently issues regarding overstressing and multitasking different extracurricular activities can greatly impact a student’s academic performance. Some related studies states that  students who involve themselves in extracurricular activities generally benefit in ways such as learning and applying different skills and values such as teamwork, leadership and good moral behavior. This research study is a brief and concise study on the implications of a student’s participation in extracurricular activities on the study habits of De La Salle Zobel High School Students. The purpose of this research is to identify the different effects of managing various extra-curricular activities while simultaneously coping with academic work on a person, specifically a student’s overall performance. Also to determine whether or not the activities in which high school students choose to get involved in have an effect on their academic performance. The study’s data gathering instrument mainly consists of information gathered through conducting interviews and surveys that was distributed to different students of the high school level of De La Salle Santiago Zobel School.  Data gathered from the research conducted can be beneficial in terms of  informing audiences such as psychologists and school administrators on the different implications of extracurricular activities that can bring onto a person specifically students and how it impacts their academic performance which could be used for future references.

<h2> Abstract </h2>
<font face="arial">
			This quantitative research aims to identify the influence of certain factors to the effectiveness of a student’s time management skills. How certain factors are considered big components that may affect a student’s time management and priorities. Also central of the research is mainly focusing on the factors, to further identify why these factors take such parts in time management. Where in factors may be detailed down into other positive and negative outcomes.

		<p> <h1>A Physical Guide to Better Soil and Crop Management based on their Profiled Levels of N, P, K and pH</h1>
<h2> Abstract </h2> 
<font face="arial">
			Given the results of the previous research entitled “The Effects of Ramgo Complete Fertilizer Towards the Chemical Composition of Different Types of Soil”, the researchers plan to utilize these findings as a basis on ensuring proper soil quality for the specific plants being used in the communities of Calatagan, Batangas. As a summary, the results from this research mainly indicated that there were generally significant differences in terms of how sand, loam and clay soil reacts chemically to the fertilizer, as each had varying cation exchange capacities. With this, it was concluded that despite their differences, the most ideal soil may not be determined, as the soil efficiency is dependent as well on the type of plant being used. Knowing this, the researchers were able to propose a simple project targeting soil and crop management on the community.
<br><br>
			This community is known to have 3 types of soil, namely, Calumpang Clay Loam, Taal Sandy Loam and Sibul Clay Loam. Each currently being used to grow certain types of plants such as sugarcane, rice, sorghum, coconut, fruit trees and vegetables. However, certain circumstances such as the infertility of the soil and the insufficiency of certain nutrients the soil must provide as preconditions to accommodate with a specific type of crop may have substantially significant negative effects to the yield of such crops. Thus, it is vital to understand and study the conditions within the community to propose a solution aimed to optimize such complications.

<h2> Hi! I'm Jacob Darvin </h2> <font face="arial">
			I study in De La Salle Santiago Zobel under the STEM strand. I am a researcher and research conductor who has so far helped developed 4 research papers over the past 2 years of Senior Highschool. I am involved and one of the founding members of Developer's Society, a Zobel based tech org that promotes STEM and the development of computer science related skills such as media and code. Being a part of that org helped me learn a lot of skills that chanelled onto the development of my research paper. Such skills include Photoshop, HTML, CSS and many more that I use to develop most of my group's media related outputs such as powerpoints and posters.

			Every so often I enjoy taking time off of school work and enjoy a life without academics.
